      Not everyone can just drop everything and enroll in a full-time coding bootcamp. Some of us have families. Some of us have bills to pay. Thankfully, BridgeCode offers conveniently scheduled, affordable, part-time learning. On-site, with other humans who are just as curious (and just as busy) as you.
